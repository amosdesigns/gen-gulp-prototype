 * Layout rules for the opwatch panels layout.

 * A majority of layout rules for this panels layout can be found in the plugin

 * this theme to ensure access to and use of this theme's gutter width variable.
 *
 * If panels layouts are ever moved into the theme, this file is to hold all
 * layout rules for the opwatch layout. This file should never contain
 * presentation/style rules.
